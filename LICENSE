GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

        Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you
modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you
received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, for example, semiconductor masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and “recipients” may be
individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in
a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the
earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under certain conditions, and how to view a copy of this License.
If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.

The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source
form of a work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
“Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run, and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

By modifying a covered work, you exclude from its scope any part of
the technical measures that, without this License, would have
restricted modification.  If you modify a copy held by someone who
has come into possession of it under this clause, you must cause the
modifying party to remove any problems they created to ensure that the
work remains free.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may not otherwise convey the Program without either modifying it
or including a copy of this License.  If you do not include a copy of
this License, you must cause the other party to inform you where the
license can be found, or inform them that no copy of this License has
been provided.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
   it, and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
   released under this License and any conditions added under
   section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section
   4 to "keep intact all notices".
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
   License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
   License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
   additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
   regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
   permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
   invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
   Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
   customarily used for software interchange.
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
   written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
   long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
   model, to give anyone who possesses the object code a copy of the
   Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
   covered by this License.
c) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
   place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
   Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
   further charge.
d) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
   you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
   Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
   charge under subsection 6c.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

A “User Product” is either (1) a consumer product, which is any tangible
personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or
household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer
product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For
other types of products, there is no default meaning and you should
consider the intended use of the product.

The “Installation Information” for a User Product is any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User
Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The
information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of
the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely
because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself is denied.

7. Additional Terms.

“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.  Additional
permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as
if they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid
under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of
the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions,
but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard
to the additional permissions.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for any part of the
Program where you have added an additional permission as defined in
this section, you may remove, replace, or supplement any additional
permission notices in that part, provided that you do not alter the rest
of this License.

**************************************************************************
Additional Attribution Requirement:

In addition to the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License
version 3 as stated above, any propagation, conveyance, or modification
of this Program or any work based on it (a “Derivative Work”) is subject
to the following additional condition:

  (a) Each time you distribute or publicly communicate a copy of any
  Derivative Work, you must include a clear and prominent notice that:
"This software is based on code from [this repository] and was originally
 authored by [Your Name]."
  (b) This attribution notice must appear in a location that is reasonably
  accessible to all users (for example, within each source file’s header
  comment block and in accompanying documentation).
  (c) Any Derivative Work must also be licensed under the terms of the GNU
  General Public License version 3, including this Additional Attribution
  Requirement.

If you do not comply with the Additional Attribution Requirement, then you
shall not have permission to propagate or modify the work under this License.
**************************************************************************

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify the Program except as expressly provided
under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (subject to
provision (c) below).  However, your license is reinstated only provisionally,
and subject to re-termination if you continue to violate this License.
Furthermore, changing or removing any term or condition of this License,
or failing to comply with any term or condition of this License, may
result in the immediate termination of your rights hereunder.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy
of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does
not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
propagating or modifying a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this
License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties with this License.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work
results from an entity transaction, each recipient of the covered work
shall have the licenses to the work as provided for in this License.

11. Patents.

A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use of the Program
by granting the rights to sublicense its contributions under this License.
A “contributor version” is a version of the Program that contains
contributions from one or more contributors.

If you initiate patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim)
against any party alleging that the Program or a contribution incorporated
within the Program constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,
then any patent licenses granted to you under this License for that Program
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

In the event that any provision of this License is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the License will remain in full
force and effect.

12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.
If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission
to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3
of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work,
and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License shall
continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special
requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning
interaction through a network, shall apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it, you may
choose to follow the terms and conditions either of that version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
SHALL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
CONVEY THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts
shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all
civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or
assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
